## 3D Interactive Graphics Rendering Engine cum Game Engine
### Trying to develop a 3D interactive graphics rendering engine which can also be used as game engine. Will help in improving my C++ skills. A C++ playground for myself.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Start with:

#### A beautiful book open sourced - for physically based rendering:
* Photorealistic computer graphics is ubiquitous today, with applications that include entertainment—notably, movies and video games; product design; and architecture. Donald Knuth wrote “This book has deservedly won an Academy Award. I believe it should also be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.” Read about the book [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/), which will link you to the contents of the book to [Physically Based Rendering:Contents](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html). And more fun - here is the [source code used by the book](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3).

#### Complement this book with:
* A very helpful and all in one [C++ Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) to get started with, by [TheCherno](https://twitter.com/TheCherno?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). Here is it's [github link](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel.git).

* Get started with [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials). This will help you understand 3D Graphics programming as well as help you shine your C++ skills.

## Helpful Guide:
* [Learning Path for a Game Engine Programmer](https://miloyip.github.io/game-programmer/game-programmer.pdf).

------------------------------------------------

### Get along with all of the following:
1. Learn [OpenGL in this playground](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/OpenGl_playground.git).
2. Learn building math engine
3. Learn building rendering engine
4. Learn building physics engine
5. Build a simple game with it

------------------------------------------------

### Computer Graphics Learning Resources:
1. A set of related course on Khanacademy; [Pixar in a box](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar).
2. [UC Davis MOOC on Computer Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAZhtzPI5pkAtcUVgmzdAP8g).

------------------------------------------------

## Mathematics for Computer Graphics learning resources:
1. Learn [essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and [essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) from [3Blue1Brown youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).
2. Learn [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) and [Computational science and engineering](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF706B428FB7BD52C) from [Gilbert strang](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/).
