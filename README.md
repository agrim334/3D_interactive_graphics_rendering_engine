# 3D_interactive_graphics_rendering_engine_cum_game_engine
## Trying to develop a 3D interactive graphics rendering engine which can be used as game engine. Will help in improving my C++ skills

## Helpful Guide:
* [Learning Path for a Game Engine Programmer](https://miloyip.github.io/game-programmer/game-programmer.pdf).

## Start with:
* A very helpful and all in one [C++ Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) to get started with, by [TheCherno](https://twitter.com/TheCherno?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). It's github link is [soon to be updated here as soon as cherno releases].

* Get started with [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials). This will help you understand 3D Graphics programming as well as help you shine your C++ skills.

### Get along with all of the following:
1. Learn OpenGL
2. Learn building math engine
3. Learn building rendering engine
4. Learn building physics engine
5. Build a simple game with it
