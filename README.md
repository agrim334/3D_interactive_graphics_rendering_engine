## 3D Interactive Graphics Rendering Engine cum Game Engine
### Trying to develop a 3D interactive graphics rendering engine which can also be used as game engine. Will help in improving my C++ skills. A C++ playground for myself.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Start with:

#### A beautiful book open sourced - for physically based rendering:
* Photorealistic computer graphics is ubiquitous today, with applications that include entertainment—notably, movies and video games; product design; and architecture. Donald Knuth wrote “This book has deservedly won an Academy Award. I believe it should also be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.” Read about the book [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/), which will link you to the contents of the book to [Physically Based Rendering:Contents](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html). And more fun - here is the [source code used by the book](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3).

#### Complement this book with:
* A very helpful and all in one [C++ Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) to get started with, by [TheCherno](https://twitter.com/TheCherno?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). Here is it's [github link](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel.git).

* Get started with [Ogre3D tutorials](http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Tutorials). This will help you understand 3D Graphics programming as well as help you shine your C++ skills.

------------------------------------------------

### Noteworthy open source libraries for visual computing:
1. [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) is a software project that provides easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation, such as geographic information systems, computer aided design, molecular biology, medical imaging, computer graphics, and robotics.
2. [The Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](https://vtk.org/) is an open-source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, modeling, image processing, volume rendering, scientific visualization, and 2D plotting. It supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms and advanced modeling techniques, and it takes advantage of both threaded and distributed memory parallel processing for speed and scalability, respectively.
3. [The Point Cloud Library (or PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/) is a large scale, open project [1] for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing. The PCL framework contains numerous state-of-the art algorithms including filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation.
4. [OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)](https://opencv.org/) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
5. [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. 
6. Althouh the libraries I mention in this point are far related to project topic, however they are noteworthy libraries under visual computing area :
    - [The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)](https://www.gdal.org/) is a computer software library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats. Although it is used for GIS data I have put it here because it can come under visual computing with raster GIS data.
    - Another, library which uses GDAL is [Orfeo Toolbox](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/) which also can fall under visual computing because it works on using maching learning and computer vision with GIS raster images.
